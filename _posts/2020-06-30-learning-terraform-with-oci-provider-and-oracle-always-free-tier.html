<li>Initial terraform plugins.</li>
<li>Setup connection credentials as input variables, such various
ocids, public keys etc.</li>
<li>The way of using .tfvars file is deprecated.</li>
<li>The way of configuring via SDK/CLI configuration file
<code>~/.oci/config</code> does not work.</li>
<li>Shell variables works as expected.</li>
<li>Exist oci resource, such as vcn, must be removed before always
free configuration can be applied.</li>
<li>OCI stacks is actually implemented with terraform. There's
terraform specific functions in stack's detail panel. Such as
terraform configuration download (as a zip), plan, apply,
destroy.</li>
<li>Longway to go as OCI api is rich and complex.</li>
