<p>
When you begin to live with (make use of) symblic links in
windows. You may have to remove some symbolic links for
maintainence. 
</p>

<p>
It feels all okay until symbolic links whose target are directories,
those ones created by <b>/d</b> parameters by `mklink` tool, comes into
play. 
</p>


<p>
<b>Don't</b> use the del command, as it will recursivly delete all the files
under the target directory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use</b> rmdir to delete just the symbolic link itself.
