<div id="outline-container-org4e2cdf0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4e2cdf0">publish failure in org2jeklly 0.25</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4e2cdf0">
<p>
Some time ago I started using org2jeklly to publish my blogs. All went
well until someday I did a package upgrade for all my emacs packages&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
My publish start to fail, there's no markdown file produced after I
run `M-x org2jeklly-publish`&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
There's `org-export-process exited abnorml` message in <b>Message</b> buffer.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org57389da" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org57389da">org-export-process exited abnormally issue</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org57389da">
<p>
Several hours of debug shows that the "org-export-process" related
issue was casued by there's no correct org asynchronous export setting.
</p>

<p>
To fix it add following snippet to .emacs:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(custom-set-variables
 '(org-export-async-init-file <span style="color: #008000;">"~/.emacs.d/org-async-init.el"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And create a "~/.emacs.d/org-async-init.el" with following contents:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #0000FF;">require</span> '<span style="color: #D0372D;">package</span>)
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">setq</span> package-enable-at-startup nil)
(package-initialize)

(<span style="color: #0000FF;">require</span> '<span style="color: #D0372D;">org</span>) 
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">require</span> '<span style="color: #D0372D;">ox</span>)
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">setq</span> org-export-async-debug t)

</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge1d35f2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge1d35f2">no markdown generated in post directory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge1d35f2">
<p>
It turns out to be the issue of my own configuration file. I
accidentally removed my org2jeklly package. Which cause all
org2jeklly related configurations be removed from .emacs.  
</p>

<p>
While this is a intentional behavior of package system. I also find
my "removed" org2jeklly package was actually not removed, it
remains in the local elpa package tree.
</p>

<p>
After some cleanup and reinstallation, reconfiguration work the
markdown file is able to be generated as usual.
</p>

<p>
Then there comes a new issue: no meta data generated for jeklly in
the post header!!!
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orga35d880" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga35d880">no meta data header</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga35d880">
<p>
The issue was casued some recently introduced breaking change in
org2jeklly. 
</p>

<p>
The new org2jeklly is not compatible with with
`org-md-publish-to-md` anymore.
</p>

<p>
To workaround, I have to replace the `org-md-publish-to-md`
function with `org-html-publish-to-html`.
