# Spark workflow fails for not able to access hive table

This is an odd issue. With same spark program, it will fail to access
hive table if scheduled by oozie, but runs well if run manually by
using spark-submit.


## Solution

Add hive-site.xml to the spark workflow to make sure hive context
is correctly initialized.

-   Put the hive-site.xml into hdfs

    On one of the cluster node, find the hive configuration xml
    'hive-site.xml' from /etc/hive/conf. Copy it to somewhere on hdfs.

-   Add the hive-site.xml as one of the "FILES" of spark workflow

    In Hue workflow editor, click the plus sign on "FILES" to add a
    new "FILE" element. Write the corresponding hdfs path of just
    copied 'hive-site.xml'.
