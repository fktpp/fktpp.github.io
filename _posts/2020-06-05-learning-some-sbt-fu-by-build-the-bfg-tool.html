<h2 id="org3ac77a7">I want to build the bfg tool</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ac77a7">
<p>
In my previous blog I talked about bfg the <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">bfg-repo-cleaner</a>. It is a
fast repo maintaince tool writen in scala. The developer didn't
provide any prebuilt binary downloads.
</p>

<p>
So, clone and built by myself.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga4e4903" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga4e4903">SBT do not work well the maven way</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga4e4903">
<p>
After some simple git clone. Backed with some maven knowledge and
knowning that sbt is kind of same tool.
</p>

<p>
I thought like a fool that a <code>sdk install sbt</code> followed by <code>sbt build</code>
command will built a beautiful jar in target directory as <code>maven
package</code> do.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd7991c9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd7991c9">Sbt version mismatch</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd7991c9">
<p>
Quickly I leart the first lesson from sbt: sbt will not build the
old project with latest sbt version, it will always try to build
the project with declared version. If the version is not avaiable
locally, SBT will try to download it until successed with the
downloading.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>sbt will download with project declared sbt version if not
already installed.</li>
<li>sbt will download the project declared scala version if not
already installed.</li>
<li>sbt is big! and the download is realy slow.</li>
<li>scala is big, too, alas!!!</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0f318c0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0f318c0">Sbt likes REPL</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f318c0">
<p>
After serval bindly <code>sbt foobar</code> runs without looking in to the
README a sigle sight. I learnt my second lesson from bfg project:
project README and BUILD document is important!!!
</p>

<p>
Just as maven works the mode java runs, fire and wait for the
result. sbt works the way scala runs, start a REPL and interact
with it.

<div id="outline-container-org80df7e1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org80df7e1">The power of scala runtime</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80df7e1">
<p>
The third lesson I leart from sbt is that: a pure sbt built jar will
depends on scala runtime, to make a uber jar one must use sbt
assembly plugin.
</p>

<p>
With assembly plugin applied, the KB sized pure jar will quickly
grow to 1x MB sized fat jar with power of scala runtime
embedded. There after a seperated installtion of scala is not
necessary anymore.
