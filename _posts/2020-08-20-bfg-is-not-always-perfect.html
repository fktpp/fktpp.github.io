It is really bad when this happend in your packaging procedure. Image
that, everyting should have been a binary archive being end in a text
point file in your installation media.. nightmare..
</p>

<p>
So how could it happend?

You have a repo full of binary files, and you want it to be clean
and neat.
</p>

<p>
You know that <b>bfg</b> will help you on the job. and did the
convertion with some magic file pattern like <code>*.{jpg,png,zip,gz,tar}</code>
</p>

<p>
The you replaced the repo, without any sanity test.

<h3 id="org4fb8944">Git lfs pointer files begins to show up in your source tree</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4fb8944">
<p>
You got this after every git operation, as the git hooks did not
work as expected.
</p>

<p>
They don’t understand <b>bfg</b> generated filter rules in your
<code>.gitattribute</code> file.

<h3 id="orgece9ebe">Git lfs files shows as modfied after git lfs pull</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgece9ebe">
<p>
You know that <code>git lfs pull</code> can help you with <b>pointer file</b> =&gt;
<b>binary</b> convertion.
</p>

<p>
But it do not help much, as everything converted shows up as
modfied in <code>git status</code>, as the git hooks did not work as expected.

<p>
They don’t understand <b>bfg</b> generated filter rules in your
<code>.gitattribute</code> file.

<h2 id="orga7c59df">Way to rescure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga7c59df">
<p>
Run bfg with one type of file a time, until all kind of binary files
are covered. e.g. 
</p>

<p>
For pattern <code>*.{jpg,png,zip,gz,tar}</code> previous mentioned. Run bfg
five times, for each time with only one filetype (suffix).
