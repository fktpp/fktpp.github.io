Recent days I've been reading erlang related PDF, so I have a chance to write some private notes for later review. As it is mobile century now, we never work on single device anymore. I would like to sync all my notes and my reading progress across different devices.

With some time consuming googling work finished I find there's two ready to be used solution that is able to fulfill my personal needs:
	- Adobe Acrobat Reader DC + Acrobat Reader mobile + Document Cloud
	- Foxit PDF reader + Foxit connected PDF service

The result surprised me, because I've been using Acrobat Reader DC for about a year now but never notice it is able to sync anything to Adobe managed cloud storage named Document Cloud. In fact I've been wondering for years why Acrobat Reader renamed as Acrobat Reader DC in recent update and what does that 'DC' mean.

Now comes to real life practice with the Document Cloud feature. It is really good acrobat reader for android is able to manage PDF files in Document Cloud just inside the app. Anyway when comes to the Acrobat Reader DC for windows, the long history Acrobat Reader I've been known for years, I can not find any thing Document Cloud related except that there's a hyper link opens an external browser to update my AdobeID details.

How can this happen when there's plenty of on-line help and document describe the Document Cloud feature not exist in reality?  Today I just find the answer accidentally by switching my UI language from simplified Chinese to English. All Document Cloud related menus and buttons just appear like a magic.

Okay, I am not complain about anything, just write this down for later reference.

You may also ask "why not just foxit reader? it has integrated cloud service at first place too, and it much lightweight than adobe one". While, if you are a Chinese user with devices in china market, you may know understand my feeling as a free account user of foxit. Their Chinese version on mobile device, android specifically, carries too much unnecessary feature and ADs that I can't afford to use when all what I need is just a reader with notes and progress synchronization.
