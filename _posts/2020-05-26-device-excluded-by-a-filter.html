The title is one of the serval issues I met when preparing new
harddrives for my Linux Host.
</p>

<p>
By looking at `/etc/lvm.conf` I am 100% sure that there's no filter
setup.

It turns out to be the Filesystem magic bits lefted on my used
harddrives which prevent the pvcreate command to run. Those magic bits
wont be erased by `parted` tool. One must explicitly invoke `wipefs`
command against the drive for magic bits cleanup.

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">wipefs -a /dev/sdc

Once did this, the `pvcreate` is happy processing the hard disk for
physical volume creation.
