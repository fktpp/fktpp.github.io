The title is one of the serval issues I met when preparing new
harddrives for my Linux Host.
</p>

<p>
By looking at `/etc/lvm.conf` I am 100% sure that there's no filter
setup.

<p>
It turns out to be the Filesystem magic bits lefted on my used
harddrives which prevent the pvcreate command to run. Those magic bits
wont be erased by `parted` tool. One must explicitly invoke `wipefs`
command against the drive for magic bits cleanup.

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">wipefs -a /dev/sdc
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once did this, the `pvcreate` is happy processing the hard disk for
physical volume creation.
